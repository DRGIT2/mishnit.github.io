<h2>About</h2>
<p id='about'>My name is Nitin Mishra. 
I am a technology enthusiast with business acumen, wisdom seeker, influencer, author and TEDx speaker.
I spend most of my weekends learning new stuff on github, slack, medium, reddit, dzone, firstround and highscalability.
I have always been interested in reading more about psychology tactics to influence consumers.
I try my best to learn and incorporate the best practices and frameworks to be used at workplaces across different levels.
I have been leading a strong squad which built habit-forming, end to end tech products with great customer experience at scale.
I love to manage People, Process and Product-Deliverability (3Ps). I keep Transparency, Effective Communication and expectations setting back and forth at the highest priority.
