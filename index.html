<h2>About</h2>
<p id='about'>My name is Nitin Mishra.
I am a Technology Enthusiast with Business acumen, wisdom seeker, Foodie, influencer, author and TEDx speaker.
I have always been interested in reading more about Psychology Tactics to Influence Consumers.
I try my best to learn and follow the Best Practices and frameworks to be used at workplaces across different levels.

I love to Manage People, Process and Product-Deliverability. I keep Transparency, Effective Communication and expectations setting back and forth at the highest priority.
